# Weather Web Visualizations

## **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to create a website with a Bootstrap dropdown menu to organize information pages. The data used is based on previous project work (https://github.com/Armin-1337/OpenWeatherMap-API-matplots) which used an OpenWeatherMap API to plot weather data using matplotlib. This data shows how the weather changes as you approach the equator (latitude vs. maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed). The visualizations and data are presented on the web page along with a description of the observed trends. 

The website has a navigation menu at the top of each page and each page is responsive. The website contains 7 pages including: 
* Landing page with an explanation of the project.
* 4 visualization pages (1 for each plot).
* Comparisons page showing all plots.
* Data page with the source data.

## **Tools:**
HTML - Bootstrap
